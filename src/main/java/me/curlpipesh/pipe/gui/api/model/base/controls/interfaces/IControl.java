/**
 * The 'skeleton' for "controls." Controls are, essentially, just the control
 * buttons on the titlebar of a
 * {@link Container}. A control must
 * contain a "tag table" (essentially a {@link java.util.Map} that uses
 * {@link java.lang.String} for both the key and the value). With this tag
 * table, a control should store two things:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Its type - can be one of "close," "pin," or "minimize."</li>
 *     <li>Its state - can be either "true" or "false."</li>
 * </ol>
 * The type of the control determines what it does; names should be
 * self-explanatory.
 * <p />
 * A control's state will, ideally, be stored as an
 * {@link Area}, since this is the default
 * for the rest of the components of the GUI, but this could be a
 * {@link java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D.Double}, since
 * {@link Area} is just a wrapper around that.
