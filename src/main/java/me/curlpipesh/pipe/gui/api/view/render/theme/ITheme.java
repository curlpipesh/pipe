/**
 * A {@code Theme} is essentially a "container," if you will, of
 * {@link Renderer}s that define how
 * various {@link Widget}s are
 * rendered. A {@code Theme} maintains an internal list of
 * {@link Renderer}s that it uses to
 * display various components on the screen. Any implementation of this must
 * define a way to store {@code Renderer}s, as well as a way to dynamically add
 * and remove them, and the ability to render {@code Widget}s, namely rendering
 * a standalone {@code Widget} as well as rendering a
 * {@link Container} and its children.
